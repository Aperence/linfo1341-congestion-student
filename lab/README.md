# Running your own tests with QUIC congestion control

## Prequel

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> First, make sure to have started the lab by following the instruction of the [root README](../README.md). After that, you can proceed to read the instructions given in this file.

> [!NOTE]  
> Whenever we ask you to inspect the results of a scenario with a plotting script, these commands **HAVE TO** be run on your local computer, not inside the main device that is created by the lab !

## Running the scenarios

To run a scenario, execute the following command :
```
./scenarios/NAME_SCEN
```
with NAME_SCEN the name of the scenario.

Yes, it is as simple as that !

When a scenario stops, you will be able to plot the results of this scenario (not in the main device, but in another terminal) and see how everything went.

## Description of the nine scenarios

This lab contains nine different scenarios that will enable you to progressively explore some of the key aspects of QUIC's congestion control algorithms.

### [ACK clocking](../scenarios/no_cca_low_rate)

In this first scenario, we start with a simple example: what happens when QUIC sender has no congestion control scheme, but uses a constant sending window ? With this much information, it might be difficult to know what will results from this. Let us add an hypothesis: the client sends at a rate of ~4Mbps, as it has a sending window of 10000 bytes, and a round-trip time of 20ms. Try to think about what will happen, and when you're ready, run the `scenarios/no_cca_low_rate` file, and inspect the results using 
```
python3 src/qlog_parser.py lab/shared/no_cca_low_rate/LOG_ID.qlog -d
python3 src/plot_congestion.py lab/shared/no_cca_low_rate/ --dir -f delivery_rate
```

> [!WARNING]  
> Don't forget to replace LOG_ID by the id of the file in `lab/shared/no_cca_low_rate`

#### Questions: What do you observe ? Was there any problem during the transmission ?

### [Is ACK clocking sufficient ?](../scenarios/no_cca_high_rate)

Now that we have seen what happens with a fixed sending window transmitting at a smaller rate than the bottleneck bandwidth, let us see what happens when fixed sending window results in a  rate that is greater than the bottleneck bandwidth. To do so, we will configure QUIC to transmit at a rate of 64Mbps (sending window of 400000 bytes, and a round-trip time of 50ms at minimum), as we are quite impatient and we want the upload to be done faster (damn you human, why can't you wait a bit !). You can think about what might happen, and then run the `scenarios/no_cca_high_rate` file, and inspect the results using 
```
python3 src/qlog_parser.py lab/shared/no_cca_high_rate/LOG_ID.qlog -d
```

We will also run a transmission using the CUBIC congestion control algorithm to be able to compare with it.

#### Question: How did ACK clocking perform compared to CUBIC ?

### [Starting simple : a single client with one congestion control algorithm](../scenarios/cca_single)

After this quick introduction about why congestion control is important, let's see how these algorithms behave in (quite) real situations. To do so, you can run the script `scenarios/cca_single`, first with argument `reno` to observe a classical Reno congestion control, and then with argument `cubic` to see the CUBIC version.

After that, you can check the evolution of their respective congestion windows (cwnd) by running :

```
python3 src/plot_congestion.py lab/shared/cca_single/reno --dir
python3 src/plot_congestion.py lab/shared/cca_single/cubic --dir
```

**Important note** : when using cubic for this particular scenario, we disabled the Reno friendly behavior of cubic, to better show the cubic growth of the cwnd. However, in real situations, it should be enabled to better share the bandwidth. You can experiment as a bonus exercice how cubic behave when we enable this feature by running `scenarios/cca_single cubic true` and inspect the result using 

```
python3 src/plot_congestion.py lab/shared/cca_single/cubic_reno_friendly_enabled --dir
```

#### Question: What are the main differences that you see ?
#### Bonus questions : Can you guess why cubic use a Reno friendly region ? What could be the potential advantages ?

### [Stepping up : sharing bandwidth between two clients](../scenarios/cca_share)

In the previous scenario, we have seen how each congestion control algorithm acts when it can use fully a link on its own. Let us now see what happens when 2 clients send data at the same time and have to share the ressources. You can try different combinations (Reno-CUBIC, Reno-Reno and CUBIC-CUBIC) transactions and see what happens.

Run the script `scenarios/cca_share` by passing as arguments the 2 congestion controls used for the transmission.

Once everything has run, you can see the evolution of the congestion window (cwnd) by using the plot script and replacing cca1 and cca2 by the actual congestion control schemes you passed as arguments:
```
python3 src/plot_congestion.py lab/shared/cca_share/cca1_cca2 --dir
```

You can also inspect the delivery rates using the following commands:
```
python3 src/plot_congestion.py lab/shared/cca_share/cca1_cca2 --dir -f delivery_rate
python3 src/share_bandwidth.py lab/shared/cca_share/cca1_cca2
```

#### Questions: Is the bandwidth shared fairly ? And how does the cwnd of the 2 cca evolve ?

> You can use this box to answer

> ...

### [Sharing bandwidth : even for TCP flows](../scenarios/compare_iperf)

We've seen how 2 QUIC clients share bandwidth. But in the real world, QUIC isn't the only transport protocol in use. Another one frequently used is TCP and you should already know a lot about. One question that you might ask yourself is <q>Do two separate protocols allow the sharing of the same bandwidth ?</q>, and in this test, we will answer this question. The client2 runs a TCP connection (using the iperf tool) and sends data to server2, while client1 uses a QUIC connection and sends data to server1.

Run the script `scenarios/compare_iperf` by passing as argument the control congestion you want to use, feel free to select the one you prefer between CUBIC and Reno.

After that, run the plotter by replacing CCA by the one you selected:
```
python3 src/plot_congestion.py lab/shared/compare_iperf/CCA_iperf --dir
```

Check also the results of iperf, which prints how much time it took to run, as well as the bandwidth mesured during this time. 

#### Questions: What do you observe ? Do TCP and QUIC share fairly the bandwidth, or does one flow take all the ressources for itself ?

### [When someone use an unfair congestion control algorithm...](../scenarios/without_fair_queue)

Up to now, we've seen how you can use a congestion control algorithm to share bandwidth and have a fair repartition of ressources. But what should we do when someone has a faulty congestion control algorithm and/or doesn't want to share ressources. Many companies would want to be able to use the network alone without being bothered by the actions of other people. Let us see what happen when someone tries to always send at a high rate, and how it affects the other people in the network.

To do so, run the script `scenarios/without_fair_queue` with CUBIC or Reno, where the router has a simple FIFO queue as a buffer (drop the incoming packet if the buffer is full).

Run after that the plotter with the following command and see what happened (replace CCA by the congestion control you used):
```
python3 src/plot_congestion.py lab/shared/without_fair_queue/CCA --dir -f delivery_rate -l
```

#### Questions: What do you see ? Is that a fair share of the bandwidth ?

> You can use this box to answer
>
> ...

### [...but the router saves the day](../scenarios/fair_queue)

The endhosts are not the only ones who can influence the rate of transmission in a network. Routers also have a huge influence on the rate a flow may transmit. Perhaps, dropping the last packet arrived is not a perfect solution, so let's try using a fair queue. To do so, we'll add on router1 a fair queue, using the [`fq_codel`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc-fq_codel.8.html) algorithm. This tool allow use to use a deficit round robin on different queues, and the incoming flows may be put in different queues based on the hash of their ip-port couple. Let us observe now how the bandwidth is shared between the 2 hosts.

Run the script `scenarios/fair_queue` with cubic or reno.

Run after that the plotter, while replacing CCA by the congestion control you used:
```
python3 src/plot_congestion.py lab/shared/fair_queue/CCA --dir -f delivery_rate -l
```

#### Questions: What do you see ? Is this still as unfair ?

> You can use this box to answer

> ...

### [Effect of RTT on transmission rate](../scenarios/rtt_influence)

Up until now, we have seen how the different congestion controllers behave while having a constant RTT. A question we could ask ourselves is <q>Does the RTT have any influence on the transmit rate ?</q>. Let us answer this question in this scenario !

Run the `scenarios/rtt_influence` script, one time with Reno, and the other time with CUBIC.

Plot the results using 
```
python3 src/plot_congestion.py lab/shared/rtt_influence/reno --dir -a
python3 src/plot_congestion.py lab/shared/rtt_influence/cubic --dir -a
```

#### Questions: What do you see ? Does Reno with a longer RTT takes more time to send the same amount of data ? How does it (or not) affect the growth of cwnd ? Same questions for CUBIC.

> You can use this box to answer
>
> ...

### [Wait, are you lagging ?](../scenarios/compare_long_rtt)

As the last scenario of this lab, we will analyze how different congestion control algorithms behave facing large round-trip-times.

Run the `scenarios/compare_long_rtt cubic reno` script, and compare Reno with CUBIC.

You can then plot the results using 
```
python3 src/plot_congestion.py lab/shared/compare_long_rtt/cubic_reno --dir -a
```

#### Questions: Which one does perform the best under long rtt situation ? Why is this the case ?

> You can use this box to answer
>
> ...

## Extra

### Running the scenarios with BBR/BBRv2

You can run all the above scenario who takes in argument a congestion control algorithm with bbr or bbrv2. These algorithms were not fully verified and might have strange behaviours, but it might be interesting to experiment with a non loss-based congestion control algorithm.

### Connecting to the other devices

During the lab, you may want to have access to the clients, or the router to run some custom tests. To do this, you just have to run the command:
```
./connect DEV_NAME
```
with DEV_NAME is the name of the device you want to connect to.

For example, to connect to the router1 device, simply use 
```
./connect router1
```

### QUIC server

#### How to run the server manually

To run the server, you simply have to run the following command in the home directory of server1/2:

```
python3 src/server.py --host 10.0.1.X -v VERBOSITY
```

where 
- VERBOSITY is the level of verbosity you want ({0 = no output, 1 = minor explanations, 2 = full explanations on what is happening})
- X is the id of the device, for example, if you want to run the server on server1, X = 1, thus the host should be `10.0.1.1`

A more detailed explanation of the arguments can be obtained by running `python3 ./server.py -h`.

(Note: a server is automatically started on server1 and server2 when the lab is started)

### QUIC client

#### How to run the client manually

In this lab, we will use the scenarios defined in the first section to show how QUIC congestion control works.
But you may want to test by yourself using a client, so here's how to run the client by your own.
To run the client, you simply have to run the following command in the home directory in client1/2:

```
python3 src/client.py FILENAME --host 10.0.1.X
```

where 
- FILENAME is the name of the file containing the data to be sent
- X is the id of the device running the server, for example if server1 is the server, X=1, thus the host should be `10.0.1.1`

Don't forget to add the `--keylog-file` argument if you want to use wireshark

Also, a more detailled explanation of the arguments can be obtained by running `python3 ./client.py -h`.

### Scripts

The lab relies on several scripts that are explained below. 

#### [Plot_congestion.py](../src/plot_congestion.py)

This script allows to draw plots of the different states updated during the QUIC transaction. To use it simply run the following command : 
```
python3 src/plot_congestion.py LOG_FILE
```
where LOG_FILE is the path to a qlog file generated by a client/server.

This scripts has several options : 

- `-l` : whether to show the packet losses or not (default = show losses)
- `-s` : shows a scatter plot instead of a regular plot
- `-W` : shows the $W_{max}$ variable on plot (can only be used with CUBIC)
- `-f field` : the field of congestion control you want to plot (default = cwnd). For example, to plot in BBR the evolution of the `pacing_gain`, simply put the option `-f pacing_gain`. You can check the different fields using `qlog_parser.py` with the `--list-fields` option
- `-d step_time` and `-m step_field` : define when there shouldn't be a line drawn between 2 points of the same phase. In practice, it is rare to use these arguments.
- `--dir` : consider that the LOG_FILE is a directory and all qlogs contained in this directory will be plotted (not recursive)
- `-a` : align the graphs such that they each start at time 0
- `--reno-friendly-disabled` : disable the use a Reno friendly region for CUBIC

You can also specify more than one log_file when running this script, and if more than one file is given, each one of these will be plotted on a different subplots, allowing to compare the evolution of the state of different clients at the same time. (for example, compare the evolution of cwnd of 2 clients sending data on the same link)

More details can be obtained by using the `-h` flag.

#### [Qlog_parser.py](../src/qlog_parser.py)

This file contains methods to open and filter the qlog files. But it can also be run to improve the readability of the qlog file. To do so, use the following command:

```
python3 src/qlog_parser.py IN -o OUT
```

where IN is the path to a qlog_file, and OUT is the name of the new, more readable file.

You can also obtain general informations about a transmission by using the `-d` flag, or print the list of fields using `--list-fields`.

More details can be obtained using the `-h` flag.

#### [Share_bandwidth.py](../src/share_bandwidth.py)

This script allows to show how the available bandwidth is divided between 2 hosts, to use it, simply use:

```
python3 src/share_bandwidth.py DIR -b MAX_BW
```

where:
- DIR is a path to a directory containing the 2 qlogs used for the plot
- MAX_BW is the maximum bw used for the transmission, in Mbps

#### [Plot_rtt_rate.py](../src/plot_rtt_rate.py)

This script allows to show how a congestion control algorithm is using the bandwidth, as well as the round-trip-time. You could see thus what a congestion control algorithm favors in terms of latency/bandwidth.

```
python3 src/plot_rtt_rate.py DIR
```

where:
- DIR is a path to a directory containing the 2 qlogs to compare

### Modifying the constants for the congestion controllers

If you want to modify variables of the congestion controller to see the effects it may have on the transmission, you can do it quite simply. Per example, to modify the MAX_DATAGRAM_SIZE (=MSS in TCP), you can do the following:

```
import aioquic.quic.congestion as congestion

congestion.K_MAX_DATAGRAM_SIZE = NEW_VALUE
```

This holds for any variable you want to modify in the client.py, just import the good module.

### Playing with the network configuration to emulate losses/limitations

Below we will present a list of commands to simulate losses/limitations of the network. You can paste them on the emulated devices (router1), although they also work on a real device. Be careful that on the emulated devices, you will already be in root mode, so **don't** put the sudo command.

#### Modify the rate of error with netem

```
sudo tc qdisc add dev lo root netem loss 25%
```

Running this command will make a loss of 25% of the packets on the loopback interface 

#### Modify delay

```
sudo tc qdisc add dev lo root netem delay 100ms
```

Running this command will make a delay of 100ms on the loopback interface 

#### Limiting the bandwidth using TBF

```
sudo tc qdisc add dev eth2 root tbf rate 256kbit burst 1600 limit 3000
```

By running this (not so) simple command, you will limit the bandwidth on your eth2 interface to a maximum of 256kbps

#### Deleting a previous modification

```
sudo tc qdisc del dev eth0 root
```

This command will delete the previous modifications you applied to an interface

#### Comprehensive explanations to go further

The commands above are just the basics we use currently in the lab. To go further, you can check [this ressource](https://www.cs.unm.edu/~crandall/netsfall13/TCtutorial.pdf), which presents another set of commands if you want to test even more configurations.

## Troubleshooting

### SSH instabilities

Some people experienced unstability while running ssh. If you encouter this problem, first we're sorry for you, and second, here's a possible work-around to still connect to the devices.

- One way of doing it is using kathara:

    ```
    kathara connect DEV_NAME -d lab
    ```

- Another way of doing it is by using directly docker:

    First, get the docker device name using by replacing DEV_NAME
    ```
    docker ps | grep DEV_NAME
    ```
    Then, you can connect to the device using 
    ```
    docker exec -it MAIN_CONTAINER_NAME /bin/bash 
    ```
